# AppBuildingChallenge
 This guide is a step-by-step process document on how to organize the App Building Challenge.

## 1. About the Event
The App Building Challenge is a 2-hour event in which participating students learn and create a MATLAB App using the MATLAB App Designer to solve a problem.

**The problem statement for the Challenge is released after the App Building Onramp Party.**

**Objective**: Design an innovative app using MATLAB App Designer based on the problem statement. The app should empower users to explore, visualize, and extract meaningful information. It should contain interactive elements and should be visually appealing. The app can be created as quickly as 5 minutes, or one can take their time to polish the app functionality and data analysis methods.

## 2. Process
- [App Building Onramp Party](https://github.com/gabyarellano/AppBuildingChallenge/blob/master/App%20Building%20Onramp.pptx): 1-hr (Use the poster to advertise it as it is meant to help students participate in an App-Building Challenge)
- Release problem statement after Onramp Party.
- Find problem statements for [Chemical Equations](https://github.com/gabyarellano/AppBuildingChallenge/tree/master/Problem%20Statements%20%26%20Solutions-%20Chemical%20Equations) and [Thermodynamics Equations](https://github.com/gabyarellano/AppBuildingChallenge/tree/master/Problem%20Statements%20%26%20Solutions-%20Thermodynamics%20Equations).
- Evaluate submissions and give scores (sec 6).
- Announce results!

## 3. How to Encourage Student Participation 
- Audience: The competition should be advertised to all students on your campus.
- Event Promotion: 
    - [Social media poster Sample.pptx](https://github.com/gabyarellano/AppBuildingChallenge/blob/master/App%20Building%20Social%20media%20poster%20Template.pptx) – A poster for social media posts. 
    - [Email Template.docx](https://github.com/gabyarellano/AppBuildingChallenge/blob/master/App%20Building_Email%20Template.docx) – An email invite explaining the competition and how to participate. 

## 4. Requirements 
- The only prerequisite to host the event is to have completed the [MATLAB Onramp](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/details/matlab-onramp/gettingstarted) and [App Building Onramp](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/details/app-building-onramp/orab). The [Build MATLAB Proficiency Learning Path](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/details/build-matlab-proficiency/lpmlbmp) is also recommended. 
- MATLAB App Designer enables you to lay out the user interface of your app using multiple components such as drop downs, axes, sliders etc. 
- The app should have at least one “axis” element for the visualizations, at least one interactive element for users to change the input (“Slider”, “Edit Field”, “Drop Down” etc.) and at least one “Button” with a call-back. Check out the [App Designer Component Gallery](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/creating_guis/choose-components-for-your-app-designer-app.html#common_components) for more details. Get started with App Designer, [App Building Onramp](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/details/app-building-onramp/orab) training! 
- The app should run without any error for the intended use and provide warning messages for potential user errors.

- If you are new to MATLAB, get started with [MATLAB Onramp](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/es/details/matlab-onramp/gettingstarted).
- Participants can choose their data analysis and visualization method. You can use theoretical equations, curve fitting, machine learning or any other method of your choice. You can use [MATLAB Data Import and Analysis Examples](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/examples.html?category=data-import-and-analysis&exampleproduct=all&newonly=&s_tid=CRUX_lftnav), [MATLAB for Data Analysis](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/data-analysis.html) and [MATLAB Plot Gallery](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/plot-gallery.html) for inspiration! 



## 6. Submissions 
- **For Classroom Event**: Participants can show the running app to host. (recommended) 
- **For Virtual Event**: Participants should submit to the host: 
    - MATLAB App along with all the necessary files to run the app: [package your app as a MATLAB App](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/creating_guis/app-sharing.html#mw_5fea00b9-7af0-4c02-a105-1543af110d27)
    - Upload your file to the MATLAB Drive or GitHub
    - Along with the app, upload a document/video explaining:
        - How should the audience interact with the app? 
        - What happens if the user makes a mistake while interacting with the app?

## 8. Prizes 
To keep students motivated to win this competition we recommend that you give prizes to the winners. It is up to you, however, to consider if/what prizes should be given for your competition. Be sure to consider whether you can logistically give out giveaways, the number of participants, and what giveaways you currently have. For example, you could give a T-shirt to the top 5 winners. But if you have over 100 participants maybe you give a T-shirt to the top 5 and a hat to the top 10. If you need more giveaways, be sure to ask for more before the start of the competition.
